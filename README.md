# Python Week 1 Assignment

Welcome to the **Python Week 1 Assignment**! This repository contains week 1 assignments and weekly quizzes (Python scripts) that you can easily download, edit, and run on your local machine. Whether you're new to Python or an experienced developer, these scripts can help you automate tasks, explore Python features, and enhance your coding skills.

## Prerequisites

To get started with these Python scripts, you need a few things set up on your computer:


1. **Python**  
   Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website:

   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

   Once installed, confirm that Python is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   
    If Python is installed correctly, you should see the version number.


2. **Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)**
   While you can use any text editor, we highly recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your editor.
   It's lightweight, customizable, and provides excellent support   for Python development.

   Installing VS Code:
    i.   Go to the VS Code website and download the installer for your operating system.
    ii.  Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.


3. **Python Extension for VS Code**
   Once you have VS Code installed, you will need to install the Python extension to provide features like IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and debugging.

   i.  Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X).
   ii. Search for "Python" and install the extension published by Microsoft.
   
Once installed, you'll have all the Python features ready in VS Code.

## How to Download the Scripts
You can download this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file.

  **Option 1: Clone with Git**
  If you have Git installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    ```

  **Option 2: Download ZIP**
  1.  Click the green "Code" button on this repository's GitHub page.
  2.  Select Download ZIP.
  3.  Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.


## How to Open and Edit the Scripts
1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Click on File > Open Folder.
3.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the scripts.
4.  Select the folder and click Open.

You should now see all your Python scripts in the VS Code file explorer.


## Running the Scripts
To run any of the Python scripts, follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal in VS Code by clicking on Terminal > New Terminal or by using the shortcut Ctrl+` (backtick).
2.  In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is located. For example:
      ```bash
      cd path/to/your/script-folder
      ```
3.   Run the script with Python by typing the following command:
      ```bash
      python script.py
      ```

  Replace script.py with the name of the script you want to run. For example, if you're running a script named hello_world.py, you would type:
  ```bash
      python hello_world.py
  ```
    
If you're using Python 3, you might need to run:
```bash
      python3 hello_world.py
  ```

This will execute the script, and you should see any output or results in the terminal.
